<p>Fort Gordon, GA – The CoVID-19 pandemic of 2020 has been nothing short of a global disaster, uprooting the very fabric of our home and work lives, while simultaneously challenging the resilience of the most capable home-bodied remote work veterans the cyber force has to offer.</p>



<p>Following the easing restrictions of shelters in place and social distancing, workers have emerged from their homes, squinting into a sunlight they hadn’t seen in months, while wearing their Saturday morning sweat pants, unable to fit into a normal pair of work pants after putting on the “#Covid-19”</p>



<p>The inability of some workers to return to a “normal” work style has drawn the ire of the battalion leadership. “I’ve really got a problem on my hands,” said LTC Marquis Du Bois. “First off, everyone’s fingers are so fat they hit two keyboard characters at a time and can’t type in their login password. Apparently the ‘Yoga with Adrienne’ program we sent them through our Facebook page didn’t do anything to keep these guys active. Sausage fingers! Also, this building has so many people in it I’m running out of power. The Fire Department is on my ass about if I plug ‘one more computer’ into the wall, the whole building will erupt in flames! I’d send these clowns out into the yard to do a little PT, but the first one we sent outside was so Vitamin-D deficient he burned to a crisp in 15 minutes.”</p>



<p>Regarding LTC Du Bois’ charged comments, SPC Oliver replied, “Look…I don’t know what else they expected us to do while teleworking? I mean, I walked every day, and on good days I even went surfing. A keyboard walk in the morning, a keyboard walk to burn off my multi-burrito lunch, and sometimes a longer keyboard walk in the evening if the girlfriend wanted to do something romantic. And oh, the internet surfing…I always caught the trending morning internet waves. Man, I like surfing!” </p>



<p>Always one for conducting “innovative” problem solving and a fierce advocate of “out of the box” thinking, CPT J. Ferdinand, who is also a subscriber to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NLCaolW-I0">Linus Tech Tips YouTube channel</a>, developed a solution that both powers the unit’s building and keeps the pounds down. “This Cycling Computer, or cyclocpewter,” began CPT Ferdinand, “forces you to keep pedaling to generate enough power for your computer. An A/C elctro magnet power inverter converts your pedals into jiggahertz. It’s really technical, and you’d need a doctorate in Electical Engineering to understand. Anyway, need to do some word processing? You’ll need at least 80 RPM’s. Wanna screw off and play a video game? That’s at least 100 RPM’s. After installing 20 of these things, the metrics are pretty good. We’ve generated over 200 jigga watts of power, which is enough to get 10 of these fat clients humming. And after a week, that equates to 127 minutes of fat burning work, 14 oporders processed, 23 versions of the same update slides we did last week, and 34.2 pounds of fat converted into the sweet smell of sweat. It’s just a modified version of those ridiculously overpriced Peleton bikes. But after that Delta Force <a href="https://www.duffelblog.com/2019/12/delta-force-rescues-woman-trapped-in-peloton-commercial/">guy rescued the Peleton lady</a>, we get a hefty Army discount on the bike frames. Cyber Up!”</p>

<p class="has-drop-cap">Within three months of its formation, <a href="https://www.spaceforce.mil/">United States Space Force</a> has filled 90% of its ranks.<br></p>



<p>Shocked at the raving success of such a young branch, Colonel Heartling of the DoD’s Inspector General was tasked by Congress to find out what–if any–unscrupulous dealings took place.<br></p>



<p>“I began my investigation by looking at the agency’s recruiters, seeing if they were offering up illegal bonuses like the <a href="https://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-national-guard-bonus-20161020-snap-story.html">California National Guard did just a few years ago</a>,” said Col Heartling.<br></p>



<p>“No sir, we don’t do that thing around here. I just offer up the facts to the recruits. We do an interview. I say ‘did you know that if you have special skills, we’ll pay you more money?,” said Space Force Recruiter Stargeant First Class Jim Trudvig.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>“I had to dig deeper, knowing that other units’ incentive pays rarely pay out, causing general disgruntlement and a sour taste in soldiers’ mouths from broken promises,” commented the fastidious colonel. “After all, I just finished an investigation at Fort Gordon’s Cyber Protection Brigade. They’ve only paid out to 31% of eligible applicants. My investigation found the culprit to be a lack of  ‘paperwork processing’ and no emphasis to get trainees through a backlogged, antiquated training pipeline. In one instance, I had reports of a command sergeant major saying ‘it’s only $250/month, I know we owe it to you, but just suck it up and do your job.’ And, while I couldn’t prove it, I kinda thought they were trying to cover up <em>something.</em>“<br></p>



<p>CyberSteaks reporters approached the Space Force Commander for comment on this unprecedented accomplishment:  “We’ve always been looking for creative ways to solve these hard problems placed in front of our Beloved Nation’s most dedicated servants. One day, the XO was zooming in on this hilarious meme he wanted to show me, and he said, ‘Enhance.’ When you enhance, things get bigger, they get better, they get done! At first,  I couldn’t believe the efficacy of such a simple imperative,  but the results were self evident. We changed the name to, wait for it…Enhanced-AIP,” said General Steven Carol.&nbsp;“This changed everything. On a side note, we’ll be issuing recruitment mugs that say ‘World’s Best Boss’ for any new recruits.”<br></p>



<p>“Got yer paperwork stuck in the tubes again? Enhance! Can’t get a slot in the requisite training? Enhanced training! It’s weird, but every time I tell the S1 to ‘enhance’ their process and get our paperwork done properly the <strong>first time</strong>, they find the intestinal fortitude to soldier up another DD200 transmittal form and make the mission happen. We had one incident where a Space Soldier’s paperwork almost exceeded our 72 hour metric, but after I threatened the staff with ‘enhanced’ accountability, the admin clerks conducted some hands across the office and found it resting peacefully in the OIC’s inbox. That’s some ‘enhanced’ motivation!”</p>



<p>As of the writing of this report, the CPB’s admin officer is still reeling from a 54% reduction in manning, when 2,403 soldiers that simultaneously entered their re-enlistment window traded a CPB re-enlistment backpack for a transfer to Space Force. It is not yet clear how this will impact the young unit’s appetite to take risks with automation and organization, but halls of Space Command have heard rumors of a “Jira” that will soon come to grease the GEARS of bureaucracy with accountability.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Quarterly metrics and staff results are in after this quarter’s debacle with the Corona virus pandemic and subsequent requirement for social distancing. USA Cyber Protection Brigade numbers are through the roof!</p>



<p>LTC Westley Fezzik said that all it took was some out of the box thinking. “Actually,  I got the idea from the <a href="https://www.duffelblog.com/2020/04/influx-of-barracks-tiger-cubs-as-stimulus-checks-arrive/">duffelblog</a>, my most trusted, #true news source.”</p>



<p>“We’d been having trouble with people coming to work when they weren’t scheduled to, or not wearing the ‘Corona Prevention’ face masks as directed for social distancing requirements out of a high desire to ‘do that cyber’. Shoot, we even had a guy insist we let him do PT at the local Gold’s gym so he could get swoll, and later, eat all the frozen burritos from the company store.”</p>



<p>“When the Ops SGM said our guys weren’t following standards, I knew we had to do something. So myself and a few other officers, including that cheap major who only eats rice and beans three meals a day, pooled our Corona stimlus checks and bought two Cyber-ian tigers. The biggest we named Cyberia, and the other, CyberTooth. It’s been a pleasure to work here since.”</p>



<p>The local building manager was especially pleased because the ops building already has a fenced in area, so no unit funds were required for this endeavor. “It’s just a hop, skip, and a jump from the fence line to the door. You gotta be quick,” said SGT Willens.</p>



<p>CyberSteaks reporters gained a pre-release draft of the units metrics. According to the ops officer, the punctual 1700 feeding time keeps anyone from leaving the building before established work hours are actually over, and threats of being fed to the tiger for non facemask compliance have kept everyone, even the unit chaplain, in line. CPB ops floor personnel reportedly published 300% more daily “Fargos”, and the Plans section pumped out one whole OPORD for the week, a 452% increase over Q1FY20. What’s especially fascinating, however, is that there have been no complaints about the duty schedule.  SGM Mike Bombay said “the subordinate units are actually volunteering to be on the duty schedule to feed the tiger. I guess that ‘my troops to task doesn’t have any wiggle room’ excuse was kind of BS.”</p>



<p>“I think I’m going to get a tiger for every building I work at in the future, ” said LTC Fezzik.</p>



<p>To date, only one Cyber officer has been fed to Cyberia and CyberTooth. Allegedly, 1LT Dan Lewis failed to complete his JQR within the allotted time frame. Appeals that the JQR had “changed 14 times in the 4 months I’ve been here,” went unheard.</p>



<p>“I’m the Tiger King now, you cyber clowns,” said LTC ‘Tiger King’ Fezzik. “The next clown caught goofing off playing Starcraft on duty hours will be a cyber-smamich. And that means I don’t have to compete with retirees at the local commissary for cheap meat. Win-win!” </p>



<p>The cheap major eating rice and beans, who never plays Starcraft, was heard muttering something about how he “will never financially recover from this.”</p>

Fort Gordon, GA, US Army Cyber Protection Brigade<br></p>



<p>Amid growing global tensions due to the recent <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html">CoronaVirus pandemic</a>,  schools have closed their doors, parks have shut their gates, airplanes are grounded, nations have bolstered their borders, and the CPB has cancelled the most social and esprit de corps building event the organization ever hosts, the <a href="https://www.fbcinc.com/e/cyberball/attendeereg.aspx">4th annual Cyber Protection Ball</a>.</p>



<p> While a global pandemic is terrible for humankind as a whole, the second worst thing that could affect any cyber soldier is a social gathering of more than three people. This sentiment is especially held by cyber soldiers at the CPB. Except, of course, by the leadership. “My Chain of Command keeps hounding me to attend this ridiculous ‘social gathering,’” said SPC Dwayne Johnston. “I mean, these things are terrible. The food isn’t my standard fare of Twinkies, Cheetos, and Mountain Dew. There are formalities like saying ‘please’ and ‘thank you,’ and I haven’t fit into my Class-A since I started this job. Hashtag No P.T.” Yes, he said “hashtag.”<br></p>



<p>“I don’t know why anyone thinks I want to hang out with them on the weekend,” commented the notoriously and meritoriously promotable Captain Greg le Prud. “I literally read technical documentation on the weekends and hack things until my eyes bleed. I don’t have time to rub elbows with brass.”<br></p>



<p>Senior warrant officers within the unit unanimously declined to attend because “all those young soldiers disgust me. They’ve never had it hard like I did ‘back in the day’” exhorted WO1 Mario Lopez, who has served a total of nine years so far.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>“We’d really been struggling to get the numbers up for people to attend this great event,” said the unit’s most senior enlisted, CSM Spartan Blotter. “We only had 250 people signed up out of the 4,000 originally invited. I’d been informally polling the lower enlisted about why they won’t come. Retorts of ‘I’m too busy binge watching Netflix’ and ‘I’m an introvert, I hate people’ were common, but others said ‘If you make that thing one giant ass LAN party, I’m in!’ One guy said if we could attend virtually, he’d bring out his whole section of the E-4 Mafia. But the boss man wasn’t having it. Something about ‘decorum’ and ‘traditions.’ But I’m a soldiers’ soldier, so I didn’t let that negativity get in the way. We need esprit de corps!<br></p>



<p>“The COVID-19 outbreak was perfect!” continued on the CSM. “Sorry if I sound insensitive, we had to cancel the actual social gathering like all the other prudent organizations did, so I pitched to the boss that we could use the virtual ball as a way to ‘reduce risk’. He bought the whole plan like an elderly person buys gift cards for a Norwegian Prince, he even added that we can use the event to justify that 40 gigawatt (sic) internet connection we’ve always wanted. Thus far, after promising to host the biggest online gaming party known to the unit, with Quake, Halo, Fortnite, Age of Empires, Command and Conquer, and League of Legends, we’ve boosted those numbers up over twelve hundred. When we promised Starcraft and Starcraft II, those numbers jumped to over 1,600!”<br></p>



<p>“The S-6 helpdesk is gonna have a helluva night with tech support that evening, but I expect everyone else to have a good time. We’ve reduced our DUI and Corona risk–and our DUI due to Corona risk!–to 0%,” the deputy commander laughed and literally winked as he spoke. “And now we can stop with that stupid and totally legal civilian clothes fundraiser.”<br>Interested in attending the CPB’s <s>annual ball</s> inaugural LAN party? <a href="http://www.123formbuilder.com/form-5338189/form">Click here, please?</a></p>

		<p>Ft. Belvoir, VA</p>
<p>Following the raving success of subordinate units, ARCYBER policy requires soldiers request permission to follow orders, according to a leaked copy of the draft memorandum.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The policy will be signed into effect by LTG Jim Froghardy next Friday, requiring that soldiers submit requests to follow order in writing through a special chain of approval that is expressly adjacent to the existing chain of command and NCO support chains. After receiving initial approval, service members will then submit their plan in writing for secondary approval before finally receiving permission to plan and execute their instructions. Before leaving, they will submit a third request to the unit’s Staff Duty, reminding the chain of command of the originally issued instructions in order to prevent so called “lapses in memory.”</p>
<p>“We call this the Form FORRR,” said ARCYBER policy guru and OPORD scriber MAJ Horowitz. “It’s an ingenious little system that I came up with myself. It’s a Form For Otherwise Redundant Record Routing. Except, it’s not actually redundant! We’ve added so many people into the routing chain that literally no one can say they didn’t know about a given TDY. I’m also looking forward to adding a corresponding daily TDY sync meeting so we can approve all of these forms moving through the TUBES!”</p>
<p>“TUBES?,” said ARCYBER G6 COL Harry. “That’s a name I haven’t heard in a long time. The Totally Useless Because Everything Sucks system was replaced by GEARS9000. No wonder we can’t get these new forms signed! [Explicative removed] planners didn’t even know we replaced the TUBES!” According to the irate G6, intra-office correspondence used to get stuck in the TUBES until ARCYBER replaced it with the Get Everything Always Returned Soon system, or GEARS9000. “Once we move this new form over to the GEARS, things will be humming,” COL Harry assured us.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To get a good read on how the new Form FORRR’s will work, CyberSteaks analysts reached out to users of the pilot system. SFC Stalwart was the first to comment: “I love this new Form FORRR. Previously, I used to file my travel authorization and it would be stamped and approved within 72 hours. That is clearly substandard. By adding the S1, S2, S3, S4, S6, S8, S9, the S12, my girlfriend, and my local homeowners association to the routing list it has made the process much better. It takes 12 weeks of NCOER-enhancing work instead of 72 hours and the price of my ticket has gone up 10 times. My tickets are so expensive I get auto upgraded to First Class <i>every time</i>!”</p>
<p>“Some of you might say that copying the 780th Cyber BDE and USACPB’s TDY request process was a bad move,” commented LTG Froghardy, “But I can promise you that even though the GEARS9000 runs on a convoluted Sharepoint centric solution inspired by the Signal corps, we’ve never been better at analyzing metrics and building in redundant backups to our already well established programs of record that track and optimize travel. This will do wonders to keep down the fraud, waste, and abuse you see rampant in those units that only use the online Defense Travel System.”</p>
<p>But what about the policies that inspired ARCYBER’s F-FORRR? CyberSteaks reporters reviewed copies of the USACPB’s TDY request process. The gist? Cyber soldiers are instructed to travel, then must submit a request to travel with a cost estimate, before filing for travel funding and actual approval using the tool (known to many as DTS) that provides them all of the estimates and information required to complete the vestigial prerequisites. The use of such optimizing policies and the resulting de-burdening of commanders from their responsibilities has dramatically sped up the process of planning and approving travel; we can assume the Form FORRR will as well. Similar subordinate policies resulted in cost increases of 842%, 10% increases in delayed or cancelled missions, but, most importantly, has increased the transparency of metrics by 347%.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Policy POC MAJ Horowitz clarified how this new policy will work. “Imagine,” he said in a phone interview late Tuesday, “A soldier gets an OPORD. What are they supposed to do? Execute? TLPs? Or worse, MDMP? We have to make sure that we can assess, supervise, and revise our plans. So I give my master sergeant an OPORD. He then submits a memo in Sharepoint, acknowledging receipt of the mission and asking permission to follow instructions. If I didn’t mean to give him that order, this is my first opportunity to get off the train…”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our interview with MAJ Horowitz lasted for nearly three hours, derailing multiple times as Horowitz repetitively reminisced about his “glory days at SAMS” and “maneuver BOLC.” At the interview’s conclusion, we were left even more certain of the efficacy of this new policy.</p>

<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">Defense Information Systems Agency - Fort Meade, Maryland</pre>


<p>“We did it. You caught us,” was the only thing Rear Admiral Simon Symantec said in a recent press release (The DISA director’s name is not to be confused with the Symantec’s Anti-Virus rootkit half of you installed in your Windows 98 days, but wouldn’t that be ironic?).</p>


<p>Not to be dissuaded by the uninformative press release from such a short-winded director, CyberSteaks reports went deep into the underbelly of the behemoth agency for something more meaty. Interviewee SPC Juan Gold, who works on the Defense Information Service Agency’s operations floor, spilled the dirty, rotten details in all its rare juiciness:</p>



<p>“Ok, here’s what I figured out when I talk to all the disgruntled GS-11 retiree’s that are working on their second pension. Apparently DISA was the first thing on the congressional budget chopping block to fund a replacement landing gear on the F-35. We had to make ends meet somehow, I mean, this machine doesn’t run on disgruntlement and Black Rifle coffee alone. If we aren’t operational, who’s going to ignore all the trouble tickets from those rocks down at Ft. Stewart complaining about a ‘slow internet?”</p>



<p>“Anyway, some of the women that work here are also FRG leaders, and they have the inside scoop on everyone. Did I say everyone? I mean, literally, everyone. Mrs. Doreen, the unofficial head of the Pentagon’s FRG, offered up this excel document on her iMac Pro as long as she could make it her last two years of water cooler gossip without doing too much ‘work’. Holy cow! This thing had the motherload. Social security numbers, phone numbers, email,  credit card numbers, and mother’s maiden name, from General Abrams all the way down to Private Zane.”</p>



<p>When Mrs. Jane Doreen offered up the data as an “innovative solution” to a “bi-partisan problem,” she was quick to reassure senior leaders that, “It’s just the standard FRG contact form we give out to everyone. No one asks why, they just fill it out.”</p>



<p>“Ok, back to my story,” interrupted SPC Gold. “Promising that no thief ever uses a social security number within one year of stealing it anyway, we figured that we could make roughly <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/08/22/how-much-hackers-get-for-social-security-numbers-on-the-black-market.html">$1-2 dollars per person</a>. With every service member in the FRG, we calculated that would keep the lights on for another three months! Since it takes nine months for the average data leak to be noticed, senior leaders figured it was worth the risk.”</p>



<p>“Look, if anyone asks, you didn’t hear this from me. But Rear Admiral Symantec said we ‘have to do whatever it takes to keep the lights on and the digital pipes pumping. If someone’s data somehow shows up on the dark web, you can just blame it on the local unit’s S1.'”</p>

<p>Recent reports from internet security researcher <a href="https://twitter.com/KomputersOn">KanyeOnKomputers </a>unveiled the Army’s most massive data breach since MG Benedict Arnold divulged the secrets of General George Washington’s troop movements and attempted to hand over the esteemed, prestigious grounds of West Point, NY.</p>



<p>Buried deep in the crevices of the Dark Web, KanyeOnKomputers identified an underground information ring detailing the ARCYBER staff’s menu choices, from how many cubes of sugar went into their coffee, to how long it had been since the resident vegan had replaced his expired half gallon of soy milk.</p>



<p>Bragging on a darknet web site, Calvin Nickmit claimed responsibility for the hack. “I was just war-driving around their new building when I picked up a WiFi signal that said ‘ARCYBER fridge’ and I had to check it out. I connected to the WiFi and Boom! there’s the Samsung family hub for the Commanding General’s break room refrigerator, with default creds! What a bunch of noobs. I mean, I thought these guys were supposed to be the premier cyber force. I picked up a six pack of kombucha, some mason jar packed kale kimchi and went to work.”</p>



<p>“Initially, I was expecting the Cyber Staff, who take the fight to the enemy in the Cyber domain on behalf of our nation to nourish their minds the way athletes build their bodies. Boy was I in for a rude awakening when I discovered their most popular meal was the ‘Nachos Cheese Dip &amp; Salsa’ Lunchables, followed by the Keto-tacular ‘Bacon-Wrapped Cauliflower BaconWrap’. No wonder everyone goes home at 1400, they got some hardcore siesta’s to attend to!”</p>



<p>CyberSteaks conducted a proof of concept verification of Nickmit’s hack and discovered that far from being the first hacker to have gained access to ‘ARCYBER fridge’, he was merely ‘columbusing’ the default credential access. Subsequent cross validation of data with infosec industry giants reveal evidence of malware associated with DPRK advanced persistent threats.</p>



<p>A senior analyst reported under the condition of anonymity that this malware was ‘ground zero’ for a new propaganda campaign originating from within the Hermit Kingdom where images of the ‘Bacon-Wrapped Cauliflower BaconWrap’ in all its bacon burrito glory was distributed amongst the populace, showing the nutritional struggle of the United States.</p>



<p>“Play stupid games, you get stupid prizes. But I’m definitely going to try one of those burritos,” said&nbsp;Nickmit.</p>

<p>Fort Gordon, GA</p>



<p>Cyber Protection Brigade (CPB) officials testified before Congress this past week that the CPB failed four of its last five operations after its internet service provider, or ISP, cut the unit’s cable line for non-payment.</p>



<p>Operations Raindeer Flotilla,  CerealKiller, “Hackerz1,” and “HaveIBeenPooneed?” failed abysmally after analysts came in from an extended lunch at the local food court to find they couldn’t login and “do that cyber.” Operation ThinClient, however, was unaffected (side note – Operation Thin Client is a CPB driven research project to determine how slow you can run a computer before a cyber operator will throw up their hands in frustration and drop their REFRAD).</p>



<p>When questioned why the CPB wasn’t paying its bills, and what the mission impact was, the unit’s operations officer responded: “We’ve had to make some tough calls between our $64,000/month internet bill and upgrading our computers from the 1990s. We thought this issue would come up sooner, but the BDE CDR hasn’t checked his email since he took over, so he never knew it was a problem.”</p>

<p><strong>Fort Gordon, GA 782nd Military Intelligence Battalion (Cyber)</strong></p>



<p>      Tensions are high after a recent cyber operation in the [redcated] region of [redacted], after MAJ Shet Dayehn of the “Special Mission Unit” of the 782nd MI BN (Cyber) made some major changes to his command post, CyberSteaks reporters found this past week. </p>



<p>     Sources that wish to remain anonymous indicated that MAJ Dayehn was responsible for overseeing a major cyber operation in [redacted], and that they were doing [redacted redacted redacted]. He wanted to make sure everyone had a solid understanding of the operation’s “Common Operating Picture,” or COP. Witnesses saw the major and two soldiers driving an office cart stacked with tv boxes knocking over bystanders in hallways. Later, witnesses saw them installing a stadium seating ampitheater in the company’s breakroom.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p> Look, this operation is the highest profile cyber operation we’ve ever done in this unit. Running SQL injects and throwing shell keys through a 7 layer inception tunnel isn’t something you can do in just one terminal. You need screens, and lots of them. Unfortunately, our S4 hasn’t procured a new piece of equipment in years, so I did what I had to do. Those extra screens let my guys acquire root level access on some n00b admin’s box in half the time it takes with those antiquated 1080p monitors.  We had just started installing my command and control server’s dashboard on this beautiful, crisp 4k monitor when hold on…do you have a clearance? Hey, I didn’t say you could write that down! </p><cite> MAJ Shet Dayehn </cite></blockquote>



<p>     Things took a turn for the worse when three company commanders from Fort Gordon’s Cyber Center of Excellence school house filed FLIPLs within three hours of each other, for 14 monitors, valued at $16.2 million. </p>



<p>      “Normally we’d write this off under our training budget, because cyber training is just plain expensive and we could roll it in to the cost of one SANS class,” said CPT Judy Jones of the School House. “But these were the nice screens we just received as part of a package deal from the contracting office. When people take stuff from the office it usually shows up on EBay within a few hours and we can recover it. When it didn’t show, we all got suspicious.” </p>



<p>     When reporters asked enlisted operators that worked for MAJ Dayehn how they felt about acquiring equipment from sister units, one person said, “Look, in today’s 2-day Amazon Prime shipping economy, it’s hard to get military equipment within one enlistment contract. We have a job to do, and some of us just want to be able to do our job at the office. I’m sure he was going to put it back when we were done.” </p>
